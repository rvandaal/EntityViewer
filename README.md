# EntityViewer

DiagramViewer is the project to start.

Using forced based layouting to draw uml class diagrams. I use this tool to quickly envision objects and their relations. There's even code to disassemble c# assemblies and show that code in a UML class.
<br>
The nice thing about forced based layouting is that you can convert requirements into forces. For example, if you might want to display inheritance relations as vertical and compositions as horizontal, you could do with a link moment force. Furthermore, weights can be linked to different forces, which can be used to indicate which requirements are more important than others.

I'm far from done with this project but for now i can use it.
